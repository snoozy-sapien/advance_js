javascript
. synchronous - ek ke baad ek code execute hoga
. single threaded - execute on single threaded

Execution Context
. execute one line of code at a time - 
a. console log 1
b. console log 2

each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing 

#Blocking Code - block the flow of program 
#Non Blocking Code - doesnot block execution 
both has its pros n cons
